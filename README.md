# ASP.NET Core API - Serilog
A start project for ASP.NET Core API with Serilog configured.

# Goals
This sample project is used to demonstrate how to add Serilog for structured logging in a barebones ASP.NET Core API project.

Serilog provides structured data logging to files, to the console, to persistence store like SQL Server, to Email, etc..

# Getting Started
You should be able to clone the repo and start running it in Visual Studio right away.

# Additional Notes
